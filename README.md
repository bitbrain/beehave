**[Beehave](https://bitbra.in/beehave) is a powerful addon for Godot Engine that enables you to create robust AI systems using behavior trees.** With Beehave, you can easily design complex NPC behaviors, build challenging boss battles, and create other advanced setups with ease.

Using behavior trees, Beehave makes it simple to create highly adaptive AI that responds to changes in the game world and overcomes unexpected obstacles. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Beehave is the perfect tool to take your game AI to the next level.

# 📚 Getting started

Behavior trees are a modular way to build AI logic for your game. For simple AI, behavior trees are definitely overkill, however, for more complex AI interactions, behavior trees can help you to better manage changes and re-use logic across all NPCs.
