# Blackboard
The `Blackboard` is an object that can be used to store and access data between multiple nodes. By default, every `BeehaveTree` manages its own instance of a blackboard. Moreover, you are able to create a new blackboard in your scene and reference it via the blackboard property on the beehave tree! This allows you to share the same blackboard between multiple trees.
